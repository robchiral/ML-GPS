# ML-GPS

## Overview
This is the GitHub repository for **ML-GPS: a machine learning-assisted genetic priority score**.

### Reference
Chen R, Duffy √Å, Petrazzini BO, Vy HM, Stein D, Mort M, Park JK, Schlessinger A, Itan Y, Cooper DN, Jordan DM, Rocheleau G, Do R. Expanding drug targets for 112 chronic diseases using a machine learning-assisted genetic priority score. *Nat Commun.* 2024 Oct 15;15(1):8891. doi: [10.1038/s41467-024-53333-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53333-y).

## ML-GPS Predictions
- **Interactive results**: The top 10% of ML-GPS and ML-GPS DOE predictions can be viewed at [this web application](https://rstudio-connect.hpc.mssm.edu/mlgps/).
- **Full predictions**: Available for download at [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10939110).

## Requirements
- Python **3.11.6**
- Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Running the Analysis
The repository contains six Jupyter notebooks required for data cleaning, training ML-GPS and ML-GPS DOE models, and reproducing figures. **Run these notebooks in order**:

1. **Create cleaned files.ipynb**
2. **Create inputs for training.ipynb**
3. **Analyze univariate associations.ipynb**
4. **Training ML-GPS and ML-GPS DOE models.ipynb**
5. **Calculating additional metrics.ipynb**
6. **Formatting final predictions.ipynb**

## Required External Datasets
Several directories must be downloaded from the Zenodo repository ([doi:10.5281/zenodo.10939110](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10939110)) as they are too large to be hosted on GitHub:

- **Cleaned files** (Generated in Step 1; required for Steps 2 and beyond)
- **Datasets** (Generated in Step 2; required for Steps 3 and beyond)
- **Models** (Generated in Step 4; required for Steps 5 and beyond)
- **OT_2024.9** (Generated in Step 0; required for Steps 1 and beyond)
- **Raw files** (Required for all steps)

## Important Updates
Results in the Jupyter notebooks **slightly differ** from those in the original manuscript due to improvements and error corrections:

1. **Updated Open Targets dataset**: Uses release **2024.9** instead of **2023.3**.
2. **Fixed DOE model direction error**: Previously, direction-of-effect for rare and ultrarare variants was incorrectly incorporated.
3. **Adjusted phase-based weighting in DOE model**: Decreased weighting to improve model performance.
4. **OMIM feature refinement**: Now uses **OMIM gene-level annotations** instead of OMIM variants, reducing redundancy with ClinVar.
5. **Increased maximum LightGBM iterations**: Increased from **500 to 1000**, with early stopping after **10 iterations** of no improvement.
